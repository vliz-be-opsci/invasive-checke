Input file for the IJI invasive checker to be run on the ARMS data for the second time (Feb, 2024). The file [ARMS_SpeciesPerObservatory_18S.xlsx](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/lw-iji-invasive-checker/blob/main/notebooks/ARMSrun2/ARMS_SpeciesPerObservatory_18S.xlsx) actually contains the species for COI and 18S (the file is called _18S because I was not sure if that type of filename was hard-coded into the invasive checker, or not). Each tab of this excel file is the list of species (aphiaID) for each ARMS unit. The file [ARMS_ObservatoryInfo.xlsx](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/lw-iji-invasive-checker/blob/main/notebooks/ARMSrun2/ARMS_ObservatoryInfo.xlsx) contains the observatory+unit, latitude, longitude.
