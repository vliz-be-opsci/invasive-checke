Here you will find the notebook that explains how to use the WRIMS invasive checker. The source code of this notebook was developed for the ARMS workflow in the LifeWatch Tesseract (aka "IJI") workflow environment, and we turned it into a notebook for more general use. 

* The notebook is called [ExcelProcessing.ppynb](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/lw-iji-invasive-checker/blob/main/notebooks/Excel%20Processing.ipynb)
* Input files to the notebook can be found here: [species list per observatory](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/lw-iji-invasive-checker/blob/main/notebooks/data/ARMS_SpeciesPerObservatory_18S.xlsx) and [observatary information](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/lw-iji-invasive-checker/blob/main/notebooks/data/ARMS_ObservatoryInfo.xlsx)
