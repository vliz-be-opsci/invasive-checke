Here you will find the notebook that explains how to use the WRIMS invasive checker. The source code of this notebook was developed for the ARMS workflow in the LifeWatch Tesseract (aka "IJI") workflow environment, and we turned it into a notebook for more general use. However, please do note that the input and outputs are tailored to what the ARMS workflow required, and therefore you will probably need to reformat your own inputs to match these requirement. 

The code will take as input information about your observatory(ies) and a species list for that/those observatory(ies), and it will return the specific WRIMS information about its known non-native status in the marine region in which your observatory falls. 

* The notebook is called [ExcelProcessing.ipynb](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/lw-iji-invasive-checker/blob/main/notebooks/Excel%20Processing.ipynb)
* An example species list per observatory can be found [here](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/lw-iji-invasive-checker/blob/main/notebooks/data/ARMS_SpeciesPerObservatory_18S.xlsx). The first column contains the NBCI taxon id, the second contains the scientific name as determined by the bioiniformatics pipeline, next is the AphiaID, then the scientific name given by WoRMS, finally there is the quantity value as returned by the bioinformatics pipeline. Each tab of this excel file is the same information for each observatory that you have done analysis for (and as included in the observatory file, see the next point). 
* An example observatary information file can be found [here](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/lw-iji-invasive-checker/blob/main/notebooks/data/ARMS_ObservatoryInfo.xlsx). The first column contains the observatory name, the second the latitude, the third the longitude.
* Example input and output files can be found in the [data folder](https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/lw-iji-invasive-checker/tree/main/notebooks/data). The output information gotten from WRIMS are "present" if the species is known to be present in the location of your observatory(ies); "native" if it is specifically known to be native, "alien" if there is evidence that it is a non-native species, "invasive" if it is specifically know to be negatively non-native, and a blank if there is no information on this species.
